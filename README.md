Build Instructions
------------------

### UBUNTU (and Debian based distributions)
- Make sure you are connected to the internet
- Run the build-ubuntu.sh file.
- The script will ask you to enter the sudo password to install the dependencies packages.

$ ./build-ubuntu.sh

### FEDORA (and based distributions)
- Make sure you are connected to the internet
- Run the build-fedora.sh file.
- The script will ask you to enter the sudo password to install the dependencies packages.

$ ./build-fedora.sh

### LINUX (any distribution)
- Make sure you all the following dependencies:
automake autoconf pkg-config libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev libssl-dev libgmp-dev make g++
- Run the build-linux.sh file.

$ ./build-linux.sh


How to Mine
------------
- cpuminer -a [algoritm] -o [pool address] -u [username] -p [password]

For example, to mine a cryptonight coin (Monero, Bytecoin, etc) using the minergate pool we could have something like that:

$ ./cpuminer -a cryptonight -o stratum+tcp://xdn-xmr.pool.minergate.com:45790 -u your-email@mail.com -p x


Interpreting the Results
------------------------

When a share is accepted by the pool you will have a line like that:
- Accepted 35/35 (100%), 3.0 shares/min, 400 H, 53.77 H/s, 61C

From which:
- Accepted 35/35 (100%) - 35 shares accepted by your pool from 35 shares you have found. This represents a total of 100% of shares accepteds.
- 3.0 shares/min - You are finding an avarege of 3 shares per minute.
- 400 H - 400 hashs has been counted since the last share.
- 53.77 H/s - That's your hashrate right now.
- 61C - That's your CPU temperature.

Requirements
------------

1. A x86_64 architecture CPU with a minimum of SSE2 support. This includes
Intel Core2 and newer and AMD equivalents. In order to take advantage of AES_NI
optimizations a CPU with AES_NI is required. This includes Intel Westbridge
and newer and AMD equivalents. Further optimizations are available on some
algoritms for CPUs with AVX and AVX2, Sandybridge and Haswell respectively.
Older CPUs are supported by cpuminer-multi by TPruvot but at reduced
performance.

2. 64 bit Linux distributions linux.
This fork is spefic for Linux distributions.
Others SO are supported by cpuminer-opt by Jay D Dee.

3. Stratum pool, cpuminer-opt only supports stratum minning. Some algos
may work wallet mining but there are no guarantees.
